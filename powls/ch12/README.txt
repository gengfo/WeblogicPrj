Description
***********

As described in Chapter 12 of the book, the main example is simply a
set of configuration files and start scripts that represent the
clustered bigrez.com domain that forms the basis of our discussion of
WebLogic Server adminsitration. We have also included some of the
utility scripts that were discussed in various sections of the chapter
for your perusal.

In addition, we have provided the following three examples: 

  Example 1    Custom JMX Performance Monitoring program (Java and WLST
	       versions) described on pages 603-606. 

  Example 2    A standalone Java program that uses the WebLogic Catalog
	       Logger described on pages 618-619.

  Example 3    A simple WebLogic Server Singleton Service class
               described on page 637-638.

The included build.xml will compile the Java code provided underneath
the src directory for all three examples. The build.xml file's run
target will also execute Example 2.
