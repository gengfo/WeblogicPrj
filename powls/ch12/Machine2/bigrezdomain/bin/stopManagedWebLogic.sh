# This script is used to stop a managed WebLogic Server for the domain in
# the current working directory.  This script reads in the SERVER_NAME and
# ADMIN_URL as positional parameters, sets the SERVER_NAME variable, then
# calls the startWLS.cmd script under ${WL_HOME}/server/bin.
# 
# Other variables that startWLS takes are:
# 
# WLS_USER       - cleartext user for server startup
# WLS_PW         - cleartext password for server startup
# JAVA_OPTIONS   - Java command-line options for running the server. (These
#                  will be tagged on to the end of the JAVA_VM)
# JAVA_VM        - The java arg specifying the VM to run.  (i.e. -server, 
#                  -hotspot, etc.)
