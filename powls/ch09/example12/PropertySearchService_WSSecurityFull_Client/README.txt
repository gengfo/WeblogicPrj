== Example 12 - WS-Security SSL/Certificate Secured Web Service Client project ==

How To Build / Run
******************

1. Pre-requisites

  - Ensure you have fulfilled the pre-requisites outlined in the main Web 
    Service chapter examples readme file at:

    ../../README.txt

2. Generate the Keys, Certificates and Keystores

   Run WebLogic's CertGen tool to generate the public/private key and 
   certificate for our service client for the user 'weblogic' and run
   WebLogic's ImportPrivateKey to import the generated private key and 
   certificate into a new client-side private keystore:
  
   > . setWLSEnv.sh       (or on Windows run: setWLSEnv.cmd)
   > java utils.CertGen -keyfilepass ClientKeyPass -certfile ClientCert -keyfile ClientKey -strength 1024 -cn weblogic -ou weblogic -o Oracle -l Mytown -s Mystate -c US
   > java utils.ImportPrivateKey -keystore ClientIdentity.jks -storepass ClientStorePass -storetype JKS -alias clientcert -keypass ClientKeyPass -keyfilepass ClientKeyPass -certfile ClientCert.pem -keyfile ClientKey.pem
   
3. Add Server's Certificate to new keystore
   
   Copy the Server Certificate ('ServerCert.der') generated by the project
   'PropertySearchService_WSSecurityFull' to the root directory of this 
   client project. The run the Java keytool to import the server certificate
   into the client keystore generated in the previous step.

   > keytool -import -alias servercert -file ServerCert.der -keystore ClientIdentity.jks -storepass ClientStorePass
      
4. Clean Project

   In a command shell, change directory to the root directory containing this 
   sample project. Run the following Ant command, to clean out any old 
   compiled classes and packages:
  
   > ant clean

5. Generate Service Client Stubs

   Ensure your local WebLogic Server is running and the target Web Service 
   from the WS-Security Certificates/SSL project in Example 12 has already 
   been deployed. Run the following command to execute the ClientGen Ant task 
   which generates the Web Service stub classes using the WSDL from the 
   WebLogic hosted Web Service.

   > ant generate

6. Build and Run Project

   Run the following command which compiles all classes and runs the client 
   application's main() method to test that the web service client correctly 
   calls the WebLogic hosted web service.

   > ant
